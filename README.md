# E-commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce transaction data to derive business insights, create customer segments, and develop a lookalike model for customer recommendations. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), customer segmentation, and implementation of a lookalike recommendation system.

## Dataset Description
The analysis uses three main datasets:
1. **Customers.csv**
   - CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer
   - CustomerName: Name of the customer
   - Region: Continent where customer resides
   - SignupDate: Date when customer signed up

2. **Products.csv**
   - ProductID: Unique identifier for each product
   - ProductName: Name of the product
   - Category: Product category
   - Price: Product price in USD

3. **Transactions.csv**
   - TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction
   - CustomerID: ID of the customer who made the transaction
   - ProductID: ID of the product sold
   - TransactionDate: Date of the transaction
   - Quantity: Quantity of product purchased
   - TotalValue: Total value of transaction
   - Price: Price of product sold
